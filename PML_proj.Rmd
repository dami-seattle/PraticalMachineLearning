### The Pratical Machine Learning Project

The project goal is to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants to create model for machine learning to predict personal activity.   



```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(caret); library(ggplot2); library(dplyr);

tdata2 <- read.csv("pml-training2.csv", header=TRUE) #read preproc data
acceldata2 <- tdata2[grep("accel|classe", colnames(tdata2))] #select accel and classe data
inTrain <- createDataPartition(y=tdata2$classe, p=0.7, list=FALSE) #prep data
training <- acceldata2[inTrain,]
testiing <- acceldata2[-inTrain,]
dim(training)
```  

Review the data in the training set
```{r, echo=FALSE}
boxplot(training)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
